    <h2>Who They Suit</h2>
    <p>These shoes are designed for runners who overpronate — where the foot rolls inward excessively. Extra support helps distribute forces evenly, reducing risk of knee, hip, and shin injuries. For marathon training or daily use, stability shoes provide consistency and structure.</p>

    <h2>Testing Method</h2>
    <p>We tested each model on long runs, recovery days, and tempo efforts. Focus areas included midsole density, sidewall support, heel security, and transition smoothness. UK conditions also demand outsole grip in wet weather and breathable uppers for summer training.</p>

    <h2>Buying Checklist</h2>
    <ul class="list">
      <li>Fit first: stability features only work if the shoe is snug.</li>
      <li>Check pronation with gait analysis if unsure.</li>
      <li>Replace shoes every 300–500 miles for consistent support.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <ul class="list">
      <li><strong>Do stability shoes stop injuries?</strong> They help reduce risk but won’t guarantee injury-free running — strength and form still matter.</li>
      <li><strong>Can neutral runners wear stability shoes?</strong> Yes, but they may feel firmer than needed.</li>
      <li><strong>What’s the difference between stability and motion control?</strong> Stability supports mild–moderate overpronation, while motion control is for severe cases.</li>
    </ul>
