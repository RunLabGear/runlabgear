    <p>Training for 26.2 miles demands footwear you can trust on wet pavements, park loops and mixed paths. The right marathon training shoe balances <em>comfort</em>, <em>durability</em>, <em>energy return</em> and <em>stability</em> ‚Äî and it should stay consistent late into long runs when form starts to fade. Every pick below has been chosen with UK conditions in mind.</p>

    <h2>Who these shoes suit</h2>
    <p><strong>First-time marathoners:</strong> Prioritise comfort and fit. One reliable daily trainer (Pegasus 41 or Gel-Cumulus 26) will cover most of your plan; add a faster option later if you want extra pop for workouts.</p>
    <p><strong>Experienced runners:</strong> Build a rotation: a durable daily trainer for volume, a plated or snappy model for tempo/intervals, and ‚Äî if you like ‚Äî a race shoe for key long runs and dress rehearsals.</p>
    <p><strong>Heavier runners / niggle-prone athletes:</strong> A max-cushion option such as Glycerin 21 spreads impact over long durations without feeling wobbly.</p>

    <h2>How we test</h2>
    <ul class="list">
      <li><strong>Midsole resilience:</strong> How the foam feels at 400‚Äì600 km and after back-to-back long runs.</li>
      <li><strong>Transition & stability under fatigue:</strong> Smooth roll at easy pace and security late in long runs.</li>
      <li><strong>Upper security & comfort:</strong> Heel hold, midfoot lockdown, toe-box room for swelling.</li>
      <li><strong>Wet-road grip:</strong> Outsole traction on rainy pavements and damp park paths.</li>
      <li><strong>Value & durability:</strong> Expected lifespan of 300‚Äì500 miles for most runners.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Detailed reviews</h2>

    <h3>Nike Pegasus 41 ‚Äî The reliable workhorse (~¬£130)</h3>
    <p>The Pegasus remains the training shoe most runners can lace up for anything: easy mileage, steady long runs, strides and light workouts. Cushioning sits in the ‚Äújust right‚Äù middle ‚Äî protective without feeling mushy ‚Äî and the outsole handles abrasive UK pavements well.</p>
    <ul class="list">
      <li><strong>Best for:</strong> One-shoe-does-most marathon plans; neutral runners wanting a predictable ride.</li>
      <li><strong>Pros:</strong> Durable outsole; broad fit works for many feet; stable as fatigue sets in.</li>
      <li><strong>Cons:</strong> Not as plush as max-cushion or as snappy as plated options.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Saucony Endorphin Speed 4 ‚Äî The fast trainer (~¬£165)</h3>
    <p>Combining a nylon plate with lively PWRRUN PB foam, the Speed 4 delivers workout-day pop without the stiffness of carbon. Saucony‚Äôs SpeedRoll geometry encourages a forward roll that helps keep marathon pace ticking over when legs are heavy.</p>
    <ul class="list">
      <li><strong>Best for:</strong> Tempo runs, long intervals, marathon-pace efforts and tune-up races.</li>
      <li><strong>Pros:</strong> Light, snappy, versatile across a range of paces; upper lockdown is secure.</li>
      <li><strong>Cons:</strong> Outsole/foam won‚Äôt last as long as a daily trainer ‚Äî use it in rotation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Brooks Glycerin 21 ‚Äî Plush mileage monster (~¬£160)</h3>
    <p>For runners who value protection above all, the Glycerin 21‚Äôs DNA Loft v3 foam gives a soft yet stable platform for long, slow mileage and recovery days. It‚Äôs a favourite for heavier runners and anyone managing knee or hip niggles during big weeks.</p>
    <ul class="list">
      <li><strong>Best for:</strong> Recovery runs, easy long runs, high-mileage blocks.</li>
      <li><strong>Pros:</strong> Deep cushioning without a wobbly feel; smooth, relaxed transitions.</li>
      <li><strong>Cons:</strong> Heavier; not the shoe for fast workouts.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>ASICS Gel-Cumulus 26 ‚Äî Smooth and steady (~¬£140)</h3>
    <p>A neutral, rockered trainer with a balanced ride that makes easy days feel effortless. The upper is accommodating without being sloppy, and the outsole grips reliably in the wet. It‚Äôs an excellent everyday option for lighter runners or anyone who prefers a lower-key feel.</p>
    <ul class="list">
      <li><strong>Best for:</strong> Daily mileage, aerobic long runs, relaxed strides.</li>
      <li><strong>Pros:</strong> Comfortable, versatile, confident grip in UK weather.</li>
      <li><strong>Cons:</strong> Less ‚Äúexciting‚Äù than bouncy max-cushion or plated models.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Training tips for marathon shoes</h2>
    <ul class="list">
      <li><strong>Break-in window:</strong> 50‚Äì80 km before any key long run or race-pace workout.</li>
      <li><strong>Rotate if possible:</strong> Alternate a daily trainer with a faster shoe to reduce repetitive strain and extend lifespan.</li>
      <li><strong>Race-day practice:</strong> If you‚Äôll race in a carbon-plated ‚Äúsuper shoe‚Äù, use it for a few long runs and marathon-pace sessions to adapt.</li>
      <li><strong>Replace on feel:</strong> When midsoles feel flat, your calves/hips ache sooner, or outsole grip is clearly worn, it‚Äôs time.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Buying checklist</h2>
    <ul class="list">
      <li><strong>Fit first:</strong> A thumb‚Äôs width at the toes, secure heel, no hot spots.</li>
      <li><strong>Ride feel:</strong> Smooth transitions at easy pace; enough pop for strides.</li>
      <li><strong>Grip:</strong> Trusted traction on wet pavements and park paths.</li>
      <li><strong>Durability:</strong> Expect ~300‚Äì500 miles; rotate pairs to stretch value.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <ul class="list">
      <li><strong>Should I train in my race-day shoe?</strong> Yes, but sparingly ‚Äî a few long runs and workouts to adapt, while most mileage stays in durable trainers.</li>
      <li><strong>How many pairs do I need?</strong> At least one reliable daily trainer; ideally add a faster workout shoe for quality sessions.</li>
      <li><strong>Do I need a plate?</strong> Helpful for pacing workouts, not essential for everyone. Comfort and consistency come first.</li>
      <li><strong>How do I size for long runs?</strong> Leave a thumb‚Äôs width in the toe box to accommodate swelling; wear the socks you‚Äôll use on race day.</li>
    </ul>
