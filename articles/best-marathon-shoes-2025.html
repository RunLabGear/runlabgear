    <h2>Who They Suit</h2>
    <p>Comfort, durability and fit determine whether a shoe survives a marathon block. Midsole resilience, rocker geometry and outsole compound all influence how fresh a shoe feels at mile 20. In wet UK conditions, traction and upper security matter as much as cushioning. Our testing focuses on transition smoothness at easy paces, stability under fatigue and how the foam rebounds after back-to-back long runs.</p>
