    <h2>Who They Suit</h2>
    <p>Comfort, durability and fit determine whether a shoe survives a marathon block. Midsole resilience, rocker geometry and outsole compound all influence how fresh a shoe feels at mile 20. In wet UK conditions, traction and upper security matter as much as cushioning. Our testing focuses on transition smoothness at easy paces, stability under fatigue and how the foam rebounds after back-to-back long runs.</p>

    <h2>Buying Checklist</h2>
    <ul class="list">
      <li>Fit first: thumb’s width at toes, secure heel.</li>
      <li>Rotation beats one-shoe-for-all.</li>
      <li>Replace at 300–500 miles or when foam feels flat.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <ul class="list">
      <li><strong>Do I need carbon?</strong> Helpful for pace, not essential.</li>
      <li><strong>Break-in?</strong> 30–50 km before key long runs.</li>
      <li><strong>Sock choice?</strong> Use the same thickness you’ll race in.</li>
    </ul>
