<h2>Who these shoes suit</h2>
<p>First-time marathoners should prioritise comfort and fit. A single reliable daily trainer can take you through most of your plan; add a faster shoe later. Experienced runners benefit from a rotation: a durable daily trainer for volume and a plated or snappier model for workouts and marathon-pace efforts.</p>
<h2>How we test</h2>
<p>We consider midsole resilience over time, transition smoothness during fatigue, upper security on long runs, and wet-road grip. We synthesise lab data with field feedback across a range of paces from 5:30/km to 3:45/km.</p>
<h2>Detailed picks</h2>
<p>• Nike Pegasus 41 — A workhorse that feels predictable in the best way. Cushioning sits in the “just right” middle, with enough firmness to stay stable as the miles accumulate. The outsole wears slowly on rough pavements, and the upper accommodates most foot shapes.</p>
<p>• Saucony Endorphin Speed 4 — The nylon plate adds snap without the stiffness of carbon. The SpeedRoll geometry helps hold marathon pace in long workouts. It is less durable than a daily trainer but ideal for sharpening sessions in the last 6–8 weeks.</p>
<p>• Brooks Glycerin 21 — Plush DNA Loft v3 foam spreads impact over long durations. Heavier runners and those with a history of knee niggles tend to prefer it for Sunday long runs.</p>
<p>• ASICS Gel‑Cumulus 26 — A steady, neutral option with a rockered geometry that keeps easy days smooth. Good for lighter runners who still want cushion.</p>
<h2>Buying checklist</h2>
<ul class="list">
<li><strong>Fit:</strong> Thumb’s width in the toe box; locked heel; no hot spots.</li>
<li><strong>Ride feel:</strong> Smooth transitions with enough pop for strides.</li>
<li><strong>Durability:</strong> Expect 300–500 miles; replace when the midsole feels flat or the outsole is heavily worn.</li>
</ul>
